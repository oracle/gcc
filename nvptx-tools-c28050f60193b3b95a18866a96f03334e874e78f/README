nvptx-tools: a collection of tools for use with nvptx-none GCC toolchains.

  * nvptx-none-as: "assembler" for PTX.
  * nvptx-none-ld: "linker" for PTX.
  * nvptx-none-run: run PTX binaries compiled with -mmainkernel.
  * nvptx-none-run-single: as nvptx-none-run, locked, such that system-wide
    only one instance of it is running at a time.

Additionally, the following symlinks are installed:

  * nvptx-none-ar: link to the GNU/Linux host system's ar.
  * nvptx-none-ranlib: link to the GNU/Linux host system's ranlib.

There is a DejaGnu board file included, nvptx-none-run.exp, which can be used
as follows with the GCC testsuite:

    $ make check DEJAGNU=[build-nvptx-tools]/dejagnu.exp RUNTESTFLAGS='--target_board=nvptx-none-run' [...]

By default, this will use nvptx-none-run found in $PATH, but that can be
overridden by setting the NVPTX_NONE_RUN environment variable, for example to
[...]/nvptx-none-run-single.
